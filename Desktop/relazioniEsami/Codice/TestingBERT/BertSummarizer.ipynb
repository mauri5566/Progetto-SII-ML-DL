      "By MATT SCHWARTZ in Houston and WENDELL JAMIESON in New York Daily News Writers Saturday, October 14th 1995, 4:22AM Bleeding from a massive chest wound, Tejano star Selena cried, \"Help me! Help me! I've been shot!\" and then named her killer with her dying breath. Shaken witnesses yesterday told a spellbound Houston courtroom how the blood-covered, mortally wounded 23-year-old Hispanic singing sensation burst into the lobby of the Corpus Christi Days Inn last March 31. Gasping for breath, Selena told motel workers that Yolanda Saldivar the president of her fan club shot her once in the back. She begged, \"Close the door or she will shoot me again,\" the witnesses said. The testimony came on the third day of Saldivar's trial on charges she murdered Selena with a shot from a .38-caliber revolver when the star tried to fire her for embezzling $30,000 from two boutiques she managed for the singer. As a paramedic and motel workers recounted Selena's last desperate moments, her mother, father and brother sobbed quietly. Saldivar, as she has throughout the trial, stared blankly. Ruben Deleon, the motel's sales director, said he knelt over the dying star and asked who shot her. \"She said 'Yolanda Saldivar in room 158,' \" Deleon said. \"She was yelling, 'Help me! Help me! I've been shot,' \" said Rosalinda Gonzalez, an assistant manager. \"I asked who shot her. She said the lady in room 158. She moaned. Her eyes rolled up.\" Front desk clerk Shawna Vela said she dialed 911 and took the phone with her as she kneeled over the fallen singer, asking her what happened. \"She said 'Yolanda,' she said 'In room 158,' \" Vela testified. The first paramedic on the scene, Richard Fredrickson, testified that he arrived just two minutes after the call but it was already too late. \"The girl was covered with blood,\" he remembered. \"Blood was thick from her neck to her knees, all the way around both sides.\" Fredrickson couldn't even see the mortal wound until he cut off Selena's sweatshirt. He felt for a pulse in her neck but could feel only twitching muscles, he said. Minutes later, as he rode in an ambulance with the now unconscious Selena, he unclenched the dying woman's fist and made an ironic discovery. \"When I opened it, a ring fell out,\" he said. \"It was covered with blood.\" The 14-karat gold and diamond ring, topped with a white-gold egg, was a gift from the Grammy winner's boutique employes and Saldivar. Police have said Saldivar demanded the ring back. But before Selena could hand it over, she was shot. The singer, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was born around Easter and collected decorative eggs. The defense claims Saldivar, 35, was hysterical and shot Selena by accident. Prosecutors say it was deliberate.\n",

      "By HOLLY RAMER, Associated Press CONCORD, N.H. -- A sick American engineer who was successfully evacuated from the South Pole to New Zealand is awaiting the results of medical tests after having what doctors believed was a stroke in August. Renee-Nicole Douceur told The Associated Press in an email Tuesday that she had MRI and echocardiogram exams. She said results will be shared with doctors in the United States, \"so everyone will be on the same page.\" \"Back at hotel now to chill out,\" Douceur wrote. She added, \"So nice to see green and smell freshly cut grass, flowers, birds chirping, insects, etc., since it's now been over a year on the flat polar plateau of just ice and snow.\" She landed in Christchurch on Monday. Douceur, 58, is a Seabrook, N.H., resident who worked as a manager for research station contractor Raytheon Polar Services Co. She asked for an emergency evacuation after having what doctors believed was a stroke in August, but officials rejected her request because of bad weather, saying that sending a rescue plane was too dangerous and that her condition wasn't life-threatening. Doctors she contacted for a second opinion say a tumor may have caused her vision and speech problems. After initially having half her field of vision vanish, Douceur said last week she can now read if she concentrates on just a few words at a time. She said she sometimes jumbles words and has had trouble remembering simple lists of words during medical evaluations.\n",

      "Everyone is so excited about all the new businesses that are moving into the notoriously down-market Mid-Market area of San Francisco. Twitter! One King's Lane! Dolby Laboratories! Breathless stories have extolled the benefits of having all these tech-savvy, \"new economy\" companies move into a stretch of real estate that's been withering legitimate businesses for decades. It certainly seemed like a good opportunity to take a look at some of the businesses that have thrived in this neighborhood. And there are plenty of those - don't let those boarded-up windows fool you. Mid-Market and the Tenderloin are home to a thriving ecosystem of micro industries, and these entrepreneurs are in it for the long haul. \"Fenced goods dealers are all at the southwest corner of Market and Seventh,\" Deleano Seymour told me as we walked around the neighborhood. We glanced over at a group of young gentlemen standing outside the check-cashing store on the corner. \"When your car gets broken into and your radio gets swiped, those are the guys who buy it.\" \"What about the other side?\" I asked. The northeast corner of Market is pretty quiet, but farther down the block, between Seventh and Sixth, there's another, larger, group of young gentlemen who are usually there. \"Oh, that's weed,\" Seymour said. \"No hard drugs on Market. Just weed, stolen goods, and then the women who sell food stamps and USDA commodities. That's all that's on Mission, too. I'll show you the hard drug corners a little further up.\" Seymour has been mentioned in the pages of this newspaper as the guide for Tenderloin Walking Tours, an excellent tour he leads by appointment. He lived in the Tenderloin for 30 years, and lived it, as he told me, \"from every angle - from the highest heights to the gutter.\" Like many people who once lived on the wrong side of the law, Seymour has embraced the straight life with passion - moving to Nob Hill, wearing suits and hats no matter the occasion, offering reactionary opinions on illegal activity. (\"You want to get the drugs out of this neighborhood? All the dealers come from the East Bay. Just put the dogs on BART!\") But he hasn't forgotten his old friends now that he's gone straight. As we walk through the streets, he stops to embrace or speak to someone every few steps. He knows everyone here - and everything that's going on. \"Right now I'd say prescription drugs are the top seller on the street,\" he said. \"Those guys are making the most money right now.\" \"Those guys,\" in case you're wondering, can be found hustling their wares within the boundaries of Leavenworth, Turk, Jones and Golden Gate Avenue. They share this space with the heroin dealers, Seymour told me, but as businessmen have a fundamentally different approach. \"Prescription drug sellers are all about volume - they can make two or three thousand dollars a month selling their meds,\" he said as we walked through, watching them do just that. \"But heroin users are a smaller market, and they're very regimented people. So the sellers only come through twice a day, and they tend to sell to the same people for years. That industry is all about relationships.\" \"What about barriers to entry?\" I asked him. \"How hard is it to get a business started here?\" \"Not hard,\" he said. \"We don't have gangs in the Tenderloin, so there aren't the same battles over territory. You could set up shop right here and start selling.\" We were standing at the corner of Eddy and Jones, near the crack corners, right across the street from the Tenderloin Police Station. \"Really?\" I asked. \"I wouldn't have to worry about violence? About cops?\" \"Definitely not about cops,\" he said. \"But that's because everyone tries to keep the violence down. Violence is what brings the cops in, and that's bad for business. And violence happens when people try to move in on other people's customers. So in order to move here, you have to have your own customer base already.\" \"So you have to have a company brand already,\" I said. This all sounded pretty involved to me - and not like the sort of economic activity that could be easily uprooted by a few Internet companies. I asked Seymour whether he thought the new businesses would disrupt the current economic patterns of the neighborhood. \"No way,\" he said. \"But there's nothing for them to be worried about. Their hustle will be respected, the same as anyone else's.\" As long as the new arrivals respect the area's existing businesses, I imagine they'll have little to worry about. But it might take more than a few tax breaks and Twitter buses to bring the kind of change that City Hall is hoping to bring into Mid-Market. The technology industry is newer than the vice industry. And in economics, the more established player has the market advantage. Caille Millner is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist. E-mail: cmillner@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @caillemillner\n",

      "Vaslav Nijinsky, the great Russian dancer who was driven from the stage by madness in 1917 at the peak of his fame, recorded his thoughts and ravings in the next two years in a diary that he signed ''God Nijinsky.'' Although the diary was published in 1946 while Nijinsky was still alive, and the original handwritten volumes were sold at auction in 1979 for more than $100,000, a long-suppressed preface by the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler has now been printed for the first time, in The Archives of General Psychiatry. The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority. She replaced the preface with one of her own, which glorified her husband. According to Heinz L. Ansbacher, professor of psychology emeritus at the University of Vermont and editor of many of Adler's works, the preface is of interest not only for what it reveals about Nijinsky but also for its concise presentation of Adler's theory of schizophrenia. Adler, who joined Freud and Jung as a prominent founder of psychoanalysis, eventually went his own way, forming a school of what he called individual psychology. Nijinsky realized Adler's hopes for him by apparently regaining his sanity by the time he died in England in 1950 of a kidney disorder. Adler wrote in the preface in 1936: ''When I visited him two years ago in a sanitorium, he was quiet, well-nourished and interested in his guests. But he did not speak and only occasionally broke into a friendly laugh. The attending physician informed me that this patient was always quiet and could not be forced to speak.'' Mrs. Nijinsky, who had been married to the dancer since 1913, invited Adler to the sanitorium in Switzerland and later, because of his hopeful prognosis, she asked him to write the preface to the diary that she later found so distressing. Adler died in 1937, but his family kept the preface until 1973 before turning it over to Dr. Ansbacher. Mrs. Nijinsky, however, was still alive then and Dr. Ansbacher was asked by her agent not to make it public. Her death in Paris in 1978 freed him to seek publication. 'Badly Prepared for Life Adler said in his preface that ''our poor hero,'' Nijinsky, possessed motor, auditory and visual abilities ''far above average.'' But the analyst wrote that Nijinsky had been ''badly prepared for life, burdened from childhood with highly strained expectations, lacking the ordinary course of education, and put automatically in a class of people whose better schooling and background made him feel slighted.'' Adler believed schizophrenia grew out of an indulgence in frustrated vanity coupled with feelings of inferiority that made a person retreat from social life. He conceded that a genetic factor, perhaps some anomaly of brain structure, could explain why only certain individuals broke completely with reality. This appreciation of the possibility that physical and social causes may blend in schizophrenia is in line with most current thinking. Marked Lack of Social Interest Nijinsky had shown certain ''prepsychotic'' signs in childhood, Adler said, including ''a marked lack of social interest.'' One biographer noted: ''As a boy Nijinksy never had friends. He was by nature a solitary creature.'' When such an absence of normal personal interaction goes uncorrected, Adler maintained, the child ''expects that life will be filled with triumphs and be free of difficulties, that everything will be done for him by others, while he is striving energetically to surpass others.'' ''Hence, for a time,'' Adler said, ''the person may be extremely successful.'' Indeed, Nijinsky's dancing was legendary. ''Sooner or later,'' Adler continued, ''especially when confronted by the problems of social life, of occupation, and of love, such a person gains the impression that the environment is constantly attacking him. Not comprehending the situation, he experiences this as a repeated insult, is subjected to a series of shocks until finally his resistance is completely broken down. ''He is not prepared for a solution of his problems that would require that he give up his asocial interest in himself and that he cooperate and contribute even when conditions are difficult and unfavorable to himself. Therefore, he cuts off his relations to the world of reality and, directed solely by his style of life, is guided by the fancies and imaginings of his childhood. ''Wholly disillusioned and hopeless, he loses the remainder of his activity, which was diminished from the beginning, and turns more and more towards his 'irrational' imagination.'' In the final paragraph of the preface, however, Adler said that restoring hope was a path to cure. Adler never actually treated Nijinsky, although he was begged to take the case. ''If I had had time enough,'' Adler said, ''I think I could have helped him.'' The preface made no mention of the dancer's wife. This omission, according to Dr. Ansbacher, was unusual for Adler, who always considered a patient's social context. The diary itself made repeated negative references to her. She Stayed With Him Mrs. Nijinsky reported ''periods of violence'' between Nijinsky and herself, but she stayed with him against all advice to get a divorce. Dr. Ansbacher said, ''Romola's goal from the start was to become known as the faithful wife of the great Nijinsky, a goal for which she was willing to pay any price and which she indeed attained.'' And yet her ''mythologizing'' as Dr. Ansbacher called it, ''did not preclude good practical sense.'' She was quick to notice what conditions seemed to improve her husband and eventually helped him regain his independence and sanity. There were two steps to recovery in Nijinsky's case, as summarized by Dr. Ansbacher. In 1938 he was among the first psychiatric patients to receive insulin coma therapy, a shock treatment, which freed him of his hallucinations and enabled him to live outside the hospital, although still requiring his wife's constant care. Then in 1945, when the Russians occupied the town in Hungary where the Nijinskys were living, he began to speak to the Russian soldiers and even, one night, to jump up and dance spontaneously with them as they performed peasant dances. Dr. Ansbacher characterized this experience as ''milieu therapy'' of the type practiced today in rehabilitating schizophrenic patients. Beyond these elements, and despite the tension in the marriage, Nijinsky also had his wife's support. ''When she decided to stay with Vaslav rather than abandon him to an asylum,'' Dr. Ansbacher concluded, ''this was an act of hope that must also have communicated itself to Vaslav. Without this basic hope, Vaslav would not have met the later opportunites.'' Illustrations: photo of Vaslav Nijinsky (Page A9) Photo of Alfred Adler (Page A9)\n",

      "She sees the holes in his shoes, his lucky charms, his lack of sleep and his quieter moments. For 18 months, Callie Shell has enjoyed intimate access to the man who would be the 44th president of the United States of America - and the first black occupant of the White House. Shell has been there to capture the down moments, the nerves and weariness of Barack Obama on her camera - seen in this selection of her photographs. With exclusive access to the \"Change\" campaign, she eats, sleeps, travels and lives with her subjects. \"I like to be forgotten,\" she says. \"Then I can document their lives.\" But criss-crossing America, Shell has cultivated a unique relationship with Obama. During the New Hampshire primary in January, Obama turned to his wife Michelle on the campaign bus and said: \"The reason why Callie and I get along so well is because we've both got big ears.\" Michelle turned to Shell and said: \"Isn't it amazing he ever got a wife?\" The pair have covered thousands of miles on the road together. \"We do get along well,\" says Shell. \"He's good-looking, funny and smart.\" Watching him working on a speech, his feet up on a table, Shell was amazed to notice that Obama's shoes had two large holes, one in each sole. \"I'm not giving them up,\" he said. \"I've broken them in and they're not ready to go yet.\" Obama is superstitious like that, she says. She has seen him make speeches with his pockets full of lucky charms given by supporters. And he keeps routines. Obama, his staff, security and Shell all rise at 6am and do not go to bed until midnight. He manages to sleep only by catching brief cat-naps, which Shell insists on photographing. Obama dislikes the results, but she thinks it is important that people see he often does not sleep in a proper bed. Shell, a 47-year-old from Georgia, was Al Gore's photographer for eight years when he was Bill Clinton's vice-president. \"Gore didn't trust me at first - it took him about a year. He was hard, but Obama's easy.\" One of Shell's favourite pictures on the campaign bus is of Michelle falling asleep on Barack's shoulder while he is mid-text-message. She also captured the pair standing in a corridor, their heads touching, seizing a rare moment alone. The first time Shell photographed Obama with his family was in November 2006 before he had decided, officially, to run for the White House. Shell describes the scene: \"I'm in his kitchen, he's helping the girls get ready for school, he's about to leave for the office and Michelle's going to leave for the university. And I thought: this is going to change. It's never going to be the same again. Their life is never going to be the same again\". · Callie Shell, her camera and the would-be president guardianweekly.co.uk/politics\n",

      "A unit of CBS Corp. said Wednesday it has formed a joint venture with billionaire Anil Ambani's Reliance Broadcast Network to launch television channels in India, joining a host of foreign broadcasters hoping to tap a fast-growing market. Three English channels will start broadcasting in October 2010 and the venture would have programming rights across India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan, the companies said. Viacom Inc., Time Warner Inc., Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. have already jumped into India's TV market, which is expected to grow at 15 percent a year to become a 521 billion rupee ($11.4 billion) business by 2014. Television is the largest segment of India's entertainment industry, with revenues of 257 billion rupees ($5.6 billion) in 2009 — nearly three times what the much-hyped Bollywood film industry pulled in, according to KPMG. RELATED: INDIA REVEALS WORLD'S CHEAPEST TABLET COMPUTER AT $35 Reliance Broadcast Network said it would be pairing its understanding of Indian entertainment and advertising preferences with CBS's expertise in producing content. The channels will broadcast series such as \"Hawaii Five-0,\" ''The Defenders\" and \"Blue Bloods\" as well as current CBS shows like \"CSI\" and \"Entertainment Tonight\" via cable or satellite. The joint venture will also look into owning or operating channels in Hindi. \"The opportunities for growth and all of the data that support those facts are obviously staggering,\" Armando Nunez, president of CBS Studios International, said at a press conference. KPMG says India's TV audience has grown to 500 million viewers — still just 60 percent of households — and the number of channels has mushroomed from 120 in 2003 to over 460 in 2009. Another of Ambani's companies, Reliance Big Entertainment, last year paid $325 million for a 50 percent stake in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios.\n",

      "On a recent morning, New Line Cinema bosses Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne sat in their offices on Seventh Ave. looking over audience research on their mega movie \"The Lord of the Rings,\" which opens Wednesday. \"It has incredible awareness,\" Lynne said, jumping up from his seat. \"This is the moment before something very incredible can happen. \" \"I tend to be conservative,\" Shaye said more hesitantly. \"With some guardedness - I am very enthusiastic. \" It's hard to believe this is the same duo that within the last year has faced enough drama to transfix a movie audience, because of expensive flops like the Adam Sandler comedy \"Little Nicky\" and the Warren Beatty fiasco \"Town and Country,\" each of which cost $90 million. The Sandler film took in barely $60 million and the Beatty flick took in just $15 million at the box office. But with the debut of the movie version of J. R. Tolkien's epic saga of good and evil, the AOL Time Warner-owned studio that's been looking dumb and dumber lately has a shot at capturing the ring again. In their riskiest move to date and marking a first for Hollywood, Shaye and Lynne made three \"Lord of the Rings\" movies at once, pouring more than $270 million into a trilogy of special-effects-propelled films detailing the hobbits, dwarfs, humans, and elves of Middle-earth. The second \"Rings\" will come out next Christmas followed by the third installment a year later. Lynne and Shaye shot all three simultaneously to save on production costs, while locking in the \"Rings\" cast which includes Liv Tyler, Ian McKellan and Elijah Woods as the heroic Hobbit Frodo Baggins. The super-gamble comes at a tough time for New Line, the edgy, 35-year-old studio, founded in a lower Manhattan walk-up, that became known for turning less than sure thing projects into huge hits, like the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series and \"Dumb and Dumber. \" AOL Time Warner, which also owns the far bigger Warner Bros. movie studio - now flying high on \"Harry Potter\" and \"Ocean's Eleven\" - came down hard on Shaye and Lynne after their recent flops. This year the studio was forced to cut 20% of its staff and slash production budgets, while Shaye parted ways with one of his closest confidants, brash New Line production chief Mike DeLuca. To satisfy AOL Time Warner number crunchers, Shaye and Lynne have substantially reduced the financial downside on \"Rings. \" Through partnerships with foreign distributors, licensing agreements with companies like Burger King and JVC Electronics and tax incentives from New Zealand where the movies were shot, New Line has covered nearly 80% of the trilogy's productions costs. With pressure building on the studio, Hollywood cynics have linked New Line's very future to the success of the first \"Rings\" movie. \"AOL Time Warner is very large, the question is: Do they need another studio that makes lots of little films? \" said CIBC Oppenheimer media analyst John Corcoran. Shaye and Lynne's answer could very well be \"Rings. \" Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. \"Awareness is at big blockbuster status,\" said New Line president of marketing Russell Schwartz. The most crucial review so far has come from AOL Time Warner's newly named CEO, Dick Parsons, who told the Daily News that New Line's future was in no way tied to how well \"Rings\" performs at the box office. \"A studio doesn't hang in the balance on one film,\" Parsons said. But he didn't let New Line off easily: \"It wouldn't be good for AOL Time Warner if 'Lord of the Rings' isn't the success we think it is,\" he said. Parsons said New Line serves an important function as a source of movies to fill up AOL Time Warner's entertainment cable networks - TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies. While Parsons said he didn't expect \"Lord of the Rings\" to match \"Harry Potter's\" record breaking opening weekend, he said in the long run, \"Rings\" could be just as big as the boy wizard flick. \"I check my own sources - plain old New Yorkers,\" Parsons said, citing waiters, elevator operators, and his driver. \"They are telling me it will be huge. \" \"The momentum is growing stronger and stronger,\" agreed Gitesh Pandya, editor of Boxofficeguru. com. If \"Rings\" works, it would mean that once again New Line founder Shaye has proven he can defy the conventional wisdom in Hollywood. Over the years, he's backed risky projects and untested stars - like comic Jim Carrey before he became a superstar and now \"Rings\" director Peter Jackson. He locked in audiences with franchises like \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Austin Powers,\" and \"Rush Hour. \" Up next for New Line: a third \"Austin Powers\" and \"I Am Sam,\" a drama starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer. Shaye's renegade style caught the eye of Ted Turner who bought the independent film studio in 1993. Turner's own empire was acquired by Time Warner, which was later sold to AOL. A lawyer turned filmmaker, Shaye, 62, started out in the business in 1967 peddling B movies like \"Reefer Madness\" on college campuses. Lynne, 60, met Shaye at Columbia Law School and joined New Line in 1990. The recent tough times have clearly taken a toll on Shaye who remains passionate about running the studio - even under demanding corporate parent AOL Time Warner. \"This business is creative. The process is daunting,\" Shaye said. \"You can't get it right every time.\n",

      "Now that Matthew Weiner has put the lie to “Leave It to Beaver” and “Make Room for Daddy,” revealing the denial, need, and aggression behind the perfect 1950s family façade, we wait. We wait — something that, in this age of “on demand” and TV binging, we rarely do — to find out exactly how the “Mad Men” creator will leave each of his characters when his drama ends next year. Will the symbolism-minded Weiner show these people rising to a higher floor, elevator-style; tumbling in free-fall like the cartoon man in the title sequence; or going up and down and round and round “on a carousel”? At the end of the first half of season seven last week, all signs pointed to a happy ending, to the tune of “The Best Things in Life Are Free.” Yes, “Mad Men” and a happy ending, a somewhat oxymoronic pairing. The show has been a long, slow slide into the darkest corners of its characters’ personalities: Betty’s childlike despair, Peggy’s loneliness, Roger’s nihilism, Joan’s low self-image, and, of course, Don’s self-loathing and identity theft. The sustained mood of the series has been one of simmering discontent and alcoholic numbness, with Don dragging everyone in his life into disappointment. And yet there we were in the midseason finale, a song-and-dance step away from peace and love. Don’s shift was profound. Every season has been a study in how Don’s poor, unstable childhood has played out unconsciously in his adult life. We’ve seen him try to remake himself into a power broker with a suburban family, to lead the picture-perfect life — and yet succumb to his neurotic needs over and over again, creating lots of collateral damage in the process. Just when we’d think he had to change or lose everything, we’d join the long queue of those frustrated by Don as he undermined himself once more with a vengeance. But across the last half-season, Don seems to have become more self-aware. His lovely, platonic conversation on the plane with Neve Campbell in the first episode, the way he mentored Peggy into taking charge of the Burger Chef presentation and then proudly watched her succeed, his bittersweet acceptance when Megan broke up with him — all these moments indicated a newfound groundedness. He has hit rock bottom a number of times, but he no longer appears absolutely destined to do it again. Weiner even put Don in a somewhat saccharine scene in the penultimate episode — the dance to “My Way” with Peggy — and it felt like a sentimental resolution more than a setup for another fall. The agency realignment led by Roger in order to save Don’s job was another sign of warmth in the last episode, the kind of giddy business chess game that has become a staple of “The Good Wife.” Jim Cutler emerged as Don’s enemy more than ever, openly struggling to fire him, but Weiner was not inviting us to take Jim’s side. Roger, the quip-slinging hedonist once so passive about Don, became the rescuer, taking matters into his own hands as if to contradict Bert’s comment that he was not a leader. The day was saved for Don, quite a victory given his non grata status at the end of season six. The uniting factor in the last episode also spoke of positivity: The Apollo 11 moon landing, that “giant leap for mankind.” We’ve been watching the characters let TV into their lives, as screens appear tangentially in more and more scenes (and as Harry Crane has headed up the agency’s TV department). Suddenly, everyone was gathered together around their TV sets looking at the universe, with Don reaching out to his daughter in one of his most genuinely paternal gestures. The moon landing scenes on “Mad Men” were a kind of Kodak carousel ride, a paean to America’s lost innocence. But is it possible, really, that “Mad Men” has gone into hope mode? Will Peggy’s professional triumph spread into her personal life when the show returns? Will Joan, who made her claim for love when she rejected Bob Benson, find a romantic partner who can deal with her newly owned power? Was this last half-season a final U-turn in the show, an ending that will be followed by a seven-episode epilogue — a novel-like winding down rather than a TV-like climax? Will we move forward with the characters into the future, with the flow of history, beyond the 1960s, as the office computer shrinks and multiplies? Or was this half-season only a feint toward well-being, before Weiner leads his characters back into restlessness, the two steps backward to this one step forward? Either way, elevator or carousel, I’m betting it will be well worth waiting for.\n",

      "July 18, 2014: Audio released by Ukraine’s security agency appears to reveal separatists and Russian military officials acknowledging the shooting down of a civilian plane. Phone calls allegedly intercepted of pro-Russian rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine appear to confirm that the separatists shot down a commercial aircraft with 295 people onboard, including 27 Australians. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over Ukraine's east overnight. Authorities do not expect any survivors. A video claiming to be a tapped phone conversation between pro-Russian rebel commanders appears to confirm that the Boeing 777 airplane was taken down deliberately. The authenticity of the video, which appears to have been released by Ukrainian intelligence services, is unknown. \"We have just shot down a plane,\" a rebel commander identified as 'Bes' says. \"It fell down outside Enakievo.\" July 18, 2014: Amateur vision has surfaced of the final moments of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which crashed in Ukraine this morning. The fighter then tells his comrade that his men have set off to photograph the wreckage. A second allegedly intercepted phone call between separatist fighters in the field appears to have captured the moment the men realise they have made a fatal error. When one of the men asks about the scene of the crash his brother in arms replies, \"Well, we are 100 percent sure that it was a civilian plane. \"Are there a lot of people?,\" the rebel asks. \"F—k! The debris was falling straight into the yards,\" the soldier at the scene replies before describing wreckage that clearly identifies the flight as civilian and not military. A third intercepted phone call purports to reveal a discussion where a militant explains to a rebel leader the tragic mistake that has been made. July 18, 2014: Locals in the Ukrainian village where MH317 crashed have spoken about witnessing the plane exploding before crashing to the ground, some of them hearing gun shots before the dramatic accident. \"As to this plane shot down nearby Snezhnoe-Torez. This turned out to be a passenger one,\" the militant says. \"There is a whole lot of bodies of women and children.\" \"On TV they say like it is a Ukrainian AN-26, a transport plane. But the writing says 'Malaysian Airlines. What was it doing over the territory of Ukraine?,\" the fighter asks. \"Well then it was bringing spies,\" the man on the other end of the line replies. \"Why the hell were they flying? This is war going on.\" Firefighters extinguish a fire amongst the wreckages of the malaysian airliner carrying 295 people from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur after it crashed in rebel-held east Ukraine.

      "ONLY IN NEW YORK: Some of today's most provocative and authentic Latin Caribbean literature is being created by Dominican, Cuban and Puerto Rican women writers in Flushing, 1,500 miles from the sun of their native islands. They have been doing it for three years in the living room of Prof. Daisy De Filippis' unpretentious home, where the group comes together one Sunday per month. She and Nunzio, her husband, cook for the group. On a recent day, the smell of spaghetti and shrimp was mouth-watering. De Filippis, a highly regarded authority on Dominican literature, teaches at CUNY's York College and is the author of several books. She holds a Ph. D. from City University and is one of the founders and the driving force of these meetings, or tertulias (the word means literary circle but also social gathering). \"We are not a workshop but a mutual audience,\" explains De Filippis. \"We read to each other our works in progress and can count on honest feedback. \" The feedback, encouraging or critical, is invariably well received because the women trust one another personally and artistically. The tertuliantes break all stereotypes. Mostly working women of color and of different ages, they do not fit pre-conceived notions about who writers are or how they look. More important, their works hardly fit their societies' definition of feminine literature. \"The images we present in our writings are often not comfortable,\" De Filippis says. Actually, they are staking out new ground for female writers. Their works defy traditional feminine qualities such as virginity, docility, domesticity, fragile beauty. They deal with realities largely ignored in men's books: domestic violence, child abuse, the plight of working-class mothers. They unabashedly celebrate love, sexuality and desire the younger ones and the grandmothers in the group alike. \"We are writing an honest diary of women's lives,\" says poet Annecy Baez Hernandez. \"Women writers are marginalized in our societies, so we support each other,\" says Sonia Rivera-Valdes, also a professor at York College with a Ph. D. from CUNY. \"We trust each other because we have no extra-literary agendas. \" If De Filippis is the clear-headed leader, the freshness and authenticity of group founder Rivera-Valdes have made her its artistic inspiration. Her collection of stories, \"Las Historias Prohibidas de Marta Veneranda\" (The Forbidden Stories of Marta Veneranda), recently won Cuba's Casa de las Americas Literary Award, one of the most important in Latin America. One of the youngest women in the group is Nelly Rosario, an environmental engineer from MIT. She is currently enrolled in a master of fine arts program at Columbia University. Yet, she says, \"I learn more here than in any of the courses I have ever taken. \" Rosario writes in English a minority in the group, although others, like novelist Ynoemia Villar, write in English and Spanish. Rosario has not been published, but, she says, a chapter of \"what could be a novel\" won first prize in a prestigious literary contest at the University of Virginia. Her colleagues are beaming with pride. \"The success of one is the success of all,\" says Marianela Medrano, a poet who lives in Connecticut. At the beginning of 1994, she approached De Filippis, worried about the loneliness of Dominican women writing in the U. S. In July of that year, the first tertulia took place at De Filippis' home. The rest, as they say, is history. ANOTHER TERTULIANTE, Yrene Santos, is a well-known poet in the Dominican Republic. Inadvertently, perhaps, she wrote what could very well be the tertulia's anthem: I want to be a woman not fragmented/ to shout fearless the answers I've known for years/ and have silenced . . . And she is doing it; they are all doing it. They are also bringing a little Caribbean sun to the streets of Flushing. Only in New York.\n",
